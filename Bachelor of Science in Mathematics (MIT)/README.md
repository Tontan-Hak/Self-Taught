# Online Math classes
The MIT Mathematics currently offers several online math courses through the [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/). Right now, we have a series of 3 calculus courses equivalent to 18.01 on campus, and a series of 4 differential equations courses, equivalent to 18.03, and a course on the Laplace transform, which is equivalent to 18.031 on campus. Each courses is offered as a synchronous course with deadlines and support from TAs on the discussion forum.
